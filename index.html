I have been living and studying in District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City for 20 years. Currently, I am a second-year student with my first semester in major that is a bachelor of information technology at RMIT Vietnam University. For me, the field of science and technology, especially information technology, has brought me the passion to learn new knowledge by the vastness of the IT world. I first encountered programming in grade 8, when it was the pascal programming language as an official subject in the school curriculum. I was intrigued by the command lines and the magic of computer algorithms. Since then, I have decided to enter the computer science class at high school and have achieved the silver medal for good students in IT. Besides, not only interested in technology but also music for example playing instruments and participating in volunteer activities are my hobbies. I hope that the time I spend studying and researching information technology will help me improve my professional knowledge and hands-on experience in the technology industry.</p>

I come from Vinh Long City, after graduating from Nguyen Binh Khiem High School, I am now studying at RMIT University. Previously, I was a student specializing in Chemistry. Instead of choosing to become a doctor or pharmacist, I followed my passion and became a member of SST (School of Science and Technology). I have a great curiosity to explore the Data Industry, and I expect to be a Data Scientist. Our team name is called '4tech', which stands for 'Four for Technology.'

My hobbies are playing an instrument (piano and guitar), listening to music, and playing games. I like playing games and I’m curious about how they operate behind the scenes. I also like to sit on my computer doing research, so I think doing IT is suitable for me. I’ve had the basic knowledge about coding in Python 3.0+ as it was a part of the study program that I took part in.</p>

Currently, in 2020, I am studying Information Technology program at RMIT with specialising in web development because I want to be a full-stack developer and mobile developer. In the past, I used to have a strong passion for football and swimming because I can connect closer to my friends and I can train myself. I have won a championship in a competition in high school. I have to admit that it is the best experience and exciting during my high school lifetime. However, my passion for IT became large when I saw my big brother, a competitive programmer, solving many challenging database problems such as arrays, multidimensional arrays and matrices in an online contest every weekend. Then, I follow his path to solving problems on the Leetcode website and join a contest at the weekends.</p>

In this website, we will have these main features: Basic guidelines to Python, HTML, JAVA, C++, etc. (this part we would also have videos to demonstrate the codeline), a sharing page from other advanced coders on tips and on where to start in programming, a place where our aimed users can get a certificate from us in achieving their course. </h5><br>

We found that we were lost on our way to the purpose in this IT world and we were a bit struggling to understand the concepts/codesline. So we hope that this project can be a place to help users in defining their ways in the industry and could somehow approach the lessons easier than we did in the past. And from our side of this, we get to learn more about working as a team, get to share our knowledge and combine them together as we all have different parts of required knowledge used to make the website.</h5><br>

    <h5 class="w3-opacity w3-left w3-justify">The target of this project is to orient introductory students in the information technology field to learn the basics of programming, including two main languages, which are Python and HTML. Our team hopes to finish the project by creating a temporary website platform that is closest to complete with user-friendly and easy-to-use features. In addition, with all four members of the 4-TECH group being students of information technology, we understand the difficulty of approaching new ideas for the first time. 4-TECH brings this project with the desire to create a learning forum, sharing knowledge from seniors with the aim of promoting a passion for a programming subject. In the first phase of the project, our team will achieve a demo with the least amount of bugs within its limits and bring a positive effect and also a meaningful gift from 4-Tech for new students when the project is completed.</h5><br><br>
